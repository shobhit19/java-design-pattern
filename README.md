Strategy Design pattern :
------------------------

It is a behaivioral design pattern. If a single feature of the application are being used multiple objects to perform the same function then this design
pattern comes in to picture. Ex - Consider a blue ray player it can work on both the things either use a dvd or a blue ray disk another example would 
payment screen where we can pay using different payment option.

By behaivioral it means we are changing the behaivior of some object at run time.
Some more examples -> Google search -> text, voice, image. Shipping --> one day, immediate.



Factory Vs Strategy
-------------------
Factory -> Creational -> ex - Intially if some one who does not a car , buys a new car. or factory created a new car for us
Strategy -> Behaivioral -> ex - When we need to change the engine of the car from what was earlier we are now changing the behaivior


Factory Design Pattern
----------------------
It is a creational design pattern. Here we will be creating a type of factory which will be creating objects at run time.
Ex -> Creation of different browser objects before initiating a Driver session and passing its reference to a WebDriver interface.
